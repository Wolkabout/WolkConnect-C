Wolk\+Connect libraries are used to enable a device’s communication with \href{https://demo.wolkabout.com/\#/login}{\texttt{ Wolk\+About IoT Platform}}. Using Wolk\+Connect libraries in the software or firmware of a device will drastically decrease the time to market for developers or anyone wanting to integrate their own product with Wolk\+About IoT Platform.

Wolk\+Connect libraries are intended to be used on IP enabled devices. The available Wolk\+Connect libraries (implemented in the following programming languages \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-C}{\texttt{ C}}, \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Cpp}{\texttt{ C++}}, \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Java-}{\texttt{ Java}}, \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Python}{\texttt{ Python}}, \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Node-RED}{\texttt{ Node-\/\+R\+ED}}) are platform independent for OS based devices, with a special note that the Wolk\+Connect-\/C library is suitable to be adapted for the use on non-\/\+OS devices as Wolk\+Connect libraries have a small memory footprint. More hardware specific Wolk\+Connect libraries are available for \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-Arduino}{\texttt{ Arduino}}, \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-MicroPython}{\texttt{ Micro\+Python}} and \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/wolkabout-iot}{\texttt{ Zerynth}}.

Features of Wolk\+About IoT Platform that have been incorporated into Wolk\+Connect libraries will be disambiguated with information on how to perform these features on devices by using Wolk\+Connect’s A\+PI.

Wolk\+Connect libraries are open-\/source and released under the \href{https://github.com/Wolkabout/WolkConnect-C/blob/master/LICENSE}{\texttt{ Apache License 2.\+0}}.

\doxysubsection*{Architecture}

Wolk\+Connect library is intended to be used as a dependency in other firmware or software that have their own existing business logic. Wolk\+Connect library is not, by any means, a single service to control the device, it is a library intended to handle all the specific communication with Wolk\+About IoT Platform.

Using a Wolk\+Connect library requires minimal knowledge of Wolk\+About IoT Platform, no knowledge of the internal mechanisms and protocols of Wolk\+About IoT Platform is necessary. The user only utilizes A\+P\+Is provided by Wolk\+Connect library in the User Application Layer, thereby reducing time-\/to-\/market required.

The architecture of software/firmware where Wolk\+Connect library is meant to be used is presented in {\itshape Fig.\+1.\+1}. The gray section in {\itshape Fig.\+1.\+1} represents the developer\textquotesingle{}s software/firmware.

\doxyfigcaption{Fig.1.1 Wolk\+Connect library represented in general software/firmware architecture.}
\end{DoxyImage}
  

The gray section between the User Application Layer and the Hardware Abstraction Layer represents the user’s libraries and drivers that are required for his project. Providing Wolk\+Connect library with IP connectivity from the Hardware Abstraction Layer is expected from the user.

Wolk\+Connect library is separated into layers as shown in {\itshape Fig.\+1.\+2}

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{Fig12.png}
\doxyfigcaption{Fig.1.2 Wolk\+Connect library layers}
\end{DoxyImage}
  

Wolk\+Connect libraries use IP connectivity provided by the OS, but on devices where this is not available, it is the user’s responsibility to provide implementations for opening a socket and send/receive methods to the socket.

Communication between Wolk\+Connect library and Wolk\+About IoT Platform is achieved through the use of the \href{http://mqtt.org/}{\texttt{ M\+Q\+TT messaging protocol}}. Wolk\+Connect libraries have a common dependency, an implementation of an M\+Q\+TT client that will exchange data with an M\+Q\+TT server that is part of Wolk\+About IoT Platform. The communication between Wolk\+Connect library and Wolk\+About IoT Platform is made secure with the use of Secure Sockets Layer (S\+SL) if the device and M\+Q\+TT client library support it.

Another common dependency for Wolk\+Connect libraries is a J\+S\+ON library that is used for parsing data that is exchanged with Wolk\+About IoT Platform. This data is formatted using a custom J\+S\+ON based protocol defined by Wolk\+About IoT Platform.

The high-\/level A\+PI represents what is available to the developer that is using Wolk\+Connect library. A\+P\+Is follow the naming convention of the programming language they were written in. Consult a specific Wolk\+Connect library’s documentation for more information. The A\+PI is divided into three parts\+: connection management, data handling and device management. Data handling is independent of device management on Wolk\+About IoT Platform and therefore has a separate A\+PI. Device management is responsible for device health and this, in turn, increases the device’s lifespan.

\doxysubsection*{A\+PI\textquotesingle{}s functional description}

Wolk\+Connect libraries separate device’s functionality through the A\+PI into three distinct parts\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Connection Management}} -\/ allows controlling the connected device in order to maintain data delivery integrity\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Connect
\item Disconnect
\item Ping keep-\/alive mechanism
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Data Handling}} -\/ valuable data to be exchanged with Wolk\+About IoT Platform\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Timestamp request
\item Sensors
\item Alarms
\item Actuators
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Device management}} -\/ dynamical modification of the device properties with the goal to change device behavior\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Configuration Options
\item File Management
\item Device Software/\+Firmware Update
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysubsubsection*{Connection Management}

Every connection from Wolk\+Connect library to Wolk\+About IoT Platform is authenticated with a device key and a device password. These credentials are created on Wolk\+About IoT Platform when a device is created and are unique to that device. Only one active connection is allowed per device.

Attempting to create an additional connection with the same device credentials will terminate the previous connection. The connection is made secure, by default, in all Wolk\+Connect libraries through the use of Secure Sockets Layer (S\+SL). Connecting without S\+SL is possible. For more information, refer to specific Wolk\+Connect library documentation.

\doxyparagraph*{Connect}

A device can be connected to Wolk\+About IoT Platform in two ways\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Always connected devices}} -\/ connect once and publish data when necessary. Actuations can only be used in this case, as sending actuations from Wolk\+About IoT Platform are disabled when the device is offline.
\item {\bfseries{Periodically connected devices}} -\/ connect and publish data when needed. It is important to use disconnect here, as this is a valid device state on Wolk\+About IoT Platform -\/ controlled offline.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxyparagraph*{Disconnect}

Disconnecting will gracefully terminate the connection and the device will momentarily appear offline on Wolk\+About IoT Platform. In cases of ungraceful disconnections, eg. due to a networking error, Wolk\+About IoT Platform will be able to determine if the device is offline based on whether the device has sent its last will message.

\doxyparagraph*{Ping keep-\/\+Alive Mechanism}

The ping keep-\/alive mechanism will periodically send a message to Wolk\+About IoT Platform. This message will update the device\textquotesingle{}s last report time, which is useful if the device isn\textquotesingle{}t publishing data often, as it gives the user the information that the device is still connected. The default interval for sending messages is 60 seconds. This mechanism can also be disabled to reduce bandwidth usage.

\doxysubsubsection*{Data Handling}

Real world devices can perform a wide variety of operations that result in meaningful data. These operations could be to conduct a measurement, monitor certain conditions or execute some form of command. The data resulting from these operations have been modeled into three distinct types of data on Wolk\+About IoT Platform\+: sensors, alarms, and actuators.

Information needs to be distinguishable, so every piece of data sent from the device needs to have an identifier. This identifier is called a reference, and all the references of a device on Wolk\+About IoT Platform must be unique.

\doxyparagraph*{Timestamp request}

If the ping keep alive service is enabled on the device and a connection to the Platform has been established, then the user can request the U\+TC timestamp from the Wolk\+Connect library. This functionality is particularly useful on devices that don\textquotesingle{}t have a real time clock, as it enables them to add timestamps to their data messages. The timestamp is updated every time the ping keep-\/alive mechanism receives a response to its message.

\doxyparagraph*{Sensor readings}

Sensor readings are stored on the device before explicitly being published to Wolk\+About IoT Platform. If the exact time when the reading occurred is meaningful information, it can be assigned to the reading as a U\+TC timestamp. If this timestamp is not provided, Wolk\+About IoT Platform will assign the reading a timestamp when it has been received, treating the reading like it occurred the moment it arrived. U\+TC timestamps are integers that can be of second or millisecond precision.

Readings could be of a very high precision, and although this might not be fully displayed on the dashboard, the information is not lost and can be viewed on different parts of Wolk\+About IoT Platform.

Sensor readings like G\+PS and accelerometers that hold more than one single information and these types of readings are supported in Wolk\+Connect libraries and on Wolk\+About IoT Platform. This concept is called a multi-\/value reading.

\doxyparagraph*{Alarms}

Alarms are derived from some data on the device and are used to indicate the state of a condition, eg. high-\/temperature alarm which emerged as a result of exceeding a threshold value on the device. Alarm value can either be on or off.

Like sensor readings, alarm messages are stored on the device before being published to Wolk\+About IoT Platform. Alarms can also have a U\+TC timestamp to denote when the alarm occurred, but if the timestamp is omitted then Wolk\+About IoT Platform will assign a timestamp when it receives the alarm message.

\doxyparagraph*{Actuators}

Actuators are used to enable Wolk\+About IoT Platform to set the state of some part of the device, eg. flip a switch or change the gear of a motor.

Single actuation consists of the command to a device and feedback from the device. A command is a message that arrived at the device. Feedback is the current status of the actuator on the device which needs to be sent to Wolk\+About IoT Platform in order to complete a single actuation process. Current status has two parameters\+: actuator value and actuator state. Value is current value of the actuator, eg. for a switch, it can be true or false. Possible actuator states are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{R\+E\+A\+DY}} -\/ waiting to receive a command to change its value
\item {\bfseries{B\+U\+SY}} -\/ in the process of changing its value
\item {\bfseries{E\+R\+R\+OR}} -\/ unable to comply
\end{DoxyItemize}

To perform a successful actuation, the user needs to know the actuator references that have been defined for his device on the Platform, to forward them during the actuation initialization period. The user has to implement an actuation handler that will execute the commands that have been issued from Wolk\+About IoT Platform. Then the user has to implement an actuator status provider that will update Wolk\+About IoT Platform with the current status of the actuator. Publishing actuator statuses is performed immediately, but if the actuator takes time to be executed, eg. closing the gate, then the actuator status provider should update Wolk\+About IoT Platform with the current values until it reaches the commanded value. If the device is unable to publish the actuator status, then the information will be stored on the device until the next successful publish attempt.

To summarize, when the actuation command is issued from Wolk\+About IoT Platform, it will be passed on to the actuation handler that will attempt to execute the command, and then the actuator status provider will report back to Wolk\+About IoT Platform with the current value and the state of the actuator.

\doxysubsubsection*{Device Management}

\doxyparagraph*{Configuration}

Configuration is the dynamical modification of the device properties from Wolk\+About IoT Platform with the goal to change device behavior, eg. measurement heartbeat, sensors delivery reduction, enabling/disabling device interfaces, increase/decrease device logging level, etc.

Configuration requires the same way of handling messages as actuations do. When a configuration command is issued from Wolk\+About IoT Platform, it will be passed to the configuration handler that will attempt to execute the command. Then the configuration status provider will report back to Wolk\+About IoT Platform with the current values of the configuration parameters, with the addition that configuration parameters are always sent as a whole, even when only one value changes.

\doxyparagraph*{File Management}

Devices that have the ability to store files in permanent memory can support the file management feature. This enables the Platform to transfer files to the device in pieces via M\+Q\+TT or optionally, if the device supports it, tell the device to download a file from a U\+RL. If the device supports this feature, it is expected that the device will publish a list of files present on it as soon as it establishes connection to the Platform. Apart from commands to transfer new files to the device, the Platform can also issue commands to delete one or all files present on the device.

\doxyparagraph*{Device Software/\+Firmware Update}

Wolk\+About IoT Platform gives the possibility of updating the device software/firmware. To enable this functionality, the device is required to have file management enabled. The process is separated into two autonomous stages\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Start the process of installing a file on the device
\item Verify installed software/firmware
\end{DoxyItemize}

The device needs to be connected to the Platform and deliver current software/firmware version to Wolk\+About IoT Platform before starting to exploit utilize software/firmware update functionality.

Wolk\+About IoT Platform actuates the device to start the process of installing. The responsibility to successfully install the file is on a device, not on Wolk\+Connect library. In order to update the firmware, the user must create a firmware handler.

This firmware handler will specify the following parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Current firmware version,
\item Implementation of a firmware installer that will be responsible for the installation process, as well as the possibility of a command to abort the installation process.
\end{DoxyItemize}
